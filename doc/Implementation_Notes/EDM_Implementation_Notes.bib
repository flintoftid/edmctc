  abstract = {A diffusion equation is used to predict the sound propagation in long rooms with diffusely reflecting boundaries. The model is defined by two parameters, the coefficient of diffusion depending on the mean free path, and an exchange coefficient expressing wall absorption. The diffusion equation is solved for time-varying sources and in stationary state. Analytical expressions of sound attenuation and reverberation in infinite, semi-infinite and finite long rooms are quite in accordance with numerical simulations of diffuse sound field. It is also shown that the diffusion model allows to predict experimental observations: the decay curves are not linear, the reverberation time increases with the source–receiver distance, and sound attenuation is linear along corridors. The dependence of the coefficient of diffusion with the degree of wall diffusion is also discussed. },

  abstract = {In this paper, a modification to the room-acoustic diffusion model is proposed to take different amounts of wall scattering into account. An extensive set of numerical simulations using a cone-tracing software has first been carried out, in order to highlight the impact of the scattering coefficient on the diffusion process in rooms, in terms of sound pressure levels. An iterative method is then proposed to identify, for a given value of the wall's scattering coefficient, the diffusion constant that allows the stationary sound field to be governed by a diffusion process, regardless of the room's geometry. Using this method, an empirical law can be proposed between the diffusion constant and the scattering coefficient. The empirical diffusion model is then compared to scale model experiments, as well as to other models from the literature, with a satisfactory agreement for the sound pressure level. However, the empirical diffusion model fails to predict the sound decay for rooms with perfectly specularly reflecting surfaces, due to the inherent concept of a diffusion process.},

  abstract = {This study focuses on the modeling of sound fields in fitted rooms - i.e. rooms containing many obstacles which scatter sound. A novel approach is proposed to predict the sound-level distribution, as well as the sound decay, in such rooms. The model is derived by coupling two approaches based on a diffusion analogy. The first was initially derived for modeling the scattering of sound by obstacles in a room with specularly-reflecting surfaces. The second was proposed for modeling the reverberant field in empty rooms with diffuse surface reflections. The approach is first applied to a cubic room and to a flat enclosure, and compared to a ray-tracing model (the Rayscat model), with very good agreement. A comparison with experimental data obtained in a real fitted room is also presented, and gives very good agreement, both with the diffusion model and with the Rayscat model. In order to include mixed specular-diffuse reflections in the diffusion model, an empirical approach is also presented. The main advantage of such a technique is that it gives accurate predictions with much lower calculation times than Monte-Carlo-based numerical techniques such as ray-tracing.},

  abstract = { During the last 40 years, there has been an increasing interest on performing room acoustic simulations for several purposes; among them, to get a lower sound level, to reduce sound propagation between rooms, to increase speech intelligibility and to adjust reverberance. However, there is no universal method able to deal with every kind of scenario. Recently, a method based on the assumption that the sound energy is propagated in a similar fashion to heat transfer or particles in a gas has been proposed. This method, known as a acoustic diffusion equation model, has been successfully applied to several scenarios that may be considered as challenging, such as long rooms, flat rooms, fitted rooms and coupled rooms. The interest of this method lies on its accuracy and efficient implementation. This article presents the current state-of-the-art of this method with special emphasis to its applicability to indoor building simulation. },

Numerical comparisons are carried out for three geometrical configurations (a proportionate room, a corridor and a flat enclosure). Comparisons with the statistical theory and a ray-tracing software show that the modified boundary condition increases the accuracy of the diffusion model in term of reverberation time in all the simulated configurations. An experimental comparison in the case of a non-uniformly absorbent room (a reverberation chamber covered with patches of glass wool) is also carried out. The modified-diffusion model results match well with the ray-tracing ones. Both models are in agreement with the experimental data for most of third octave bands (discrepancy close to or below 10%). However, some discrepancies up to 40% can also be observed in a few octave bands, probably due to experimental considerations and to the modal behaviour of the room at low frequencies. },

This model has been applied to predict the sound level distribution in rooms of simple geometries with good accuracy and a relatively low calculation time. However, in situations related with (optimal) acoustic design, the need to evaluate multiple simulations may increase the computational cost. The aim of this work is to provide an approximately equivalent two-dimensional diffusion model achieving similar results with a significant reduction of the execution time. The proposed simplified model is obtained by means of the Kantorovich method. Comparisons of numerical simulations performed with the full diffusion model and the software CATT-Acoustic® are presented to show the efficiency of the simplified diffusion model.},
